Most companies break down their headcount into full- and part-time positions, which investors often translate into FTE. For translation from headcount to FTE, organizations should refer to the following guidance, as well as the IRIS glossary term on full-time equivalent. In brief, in calculating the number of full-time equivalent jobs, part-time jobs should be converted to full-time equivalent jobs on a pro rata basis, following local definitions (for example, if the standard working week equals 40 hours, a 20-hour-per-week job would be 0.5 FTE). Both full- and part-time jobs should be calculated based on the number employed as of the end of the reporting period. Seasonal or short-term jobs should be prorated based on the time worked during the reporting period. (For example, a full-time position for three months at any point during the reporting period would be 0.25 FTE.) If information about hours is not available, organizations may equate two part-time jobs to one full-time job for this calculation. Note that, in the United States, the U.S. Treasury Department defines a working week as 35 hours.\n\nIf there is significant seasonal variation in the number of workers, organizations are encouraged to average the number of FTEs over the reporting period for temporary workers, using the FTE calculation above. Where companies employ piece-rate workers, consider the headcount of the number of workers paid piece-rate and estimate the proportion of FTE represented by that category of workers (e.g., if there are 200 piece-rate workers on site each day for 6 months of the year, then FTE = 200 x 6/12 = 100). Similarly, if an organization has many workers on variable hours or contracts, including day laborers, organizations are encouraged to include the average number of workers on a typical day (total over 24 hours, if shift work), as well as the proportion of the year those employees are working.\n\nOrganizations are encouraged to report other job-related metrics to assess the quality of jobs created.

Most companies break down their headcount into full- and part-time positions, which investors often translate into FTE. For translation from headcount to FTE, organizations should refer to the following guidance, as well as the IRIS glossary term on full-time equivalent. In brief, in calculating the number of full-time equivalent jobs, part-time jobs should be converted to full-time equivalent jobs on a pro rata basis, following local definitions (for example, if the standard working week equals 40 hours, a 20-hour-per-week job would be 0.5 FTE). Both full- and part-time jobs should be calculated based on the number employed as of the end of the reporting period. Seasonal or short-term jobs should be prorated based on the time worked during the reporting period. (For example, a full-time position for three months at any point during the reporting period would be 0.25 FTE.) If information about hours is not available, organizations may equate two part-time jobs to one full-time job for this calculation. Note that, in the United States, the U.S. Treasury Department defines a working week as 35 hours. \n\nIf there is significant seasonal variation in the number of workers, organizations are encouraged to average the number of FTEs over the reporting period for temporary workers, using the FTE calculation above. Where companies employ piece-rate workers, consider the headcount of the number of workers paid piece-rate and estimate the proportion of FTE represented by that category of workers (e.g., if there are 200 piece-rate workers on site each day for 6 months of the year, then FTE = 200 x 6/12 = 100). Similarly, if an organization has many workers on variable hours or contracts, including day laborers, organizations are encouraged to include the average number of workers on a typical day (total over 24 hours, if shift work), as well as the proportion of the year those employees are working. \n\nOrganizations are encouraged to report other job-related metrics to assess the quality of jobs created. Examples of these include Worker Safety Policy (018001), Employment Benefits (OI2742), Employees Trained (OI4229), Flexible Work Arrangements (OI7983), and Employees: Minimum Wage (OI5858).\n\nThis metric is multi-dimensional with regard to the five dimensions of impact. In some contexts, this metric can serve as an indicator of whether the outcome being sought by an investor or organization is occurring (the WHAT dimension of impact). This metric may also help measure the HOW MUCH Scale dimension, which helps estimate the number of the targeted stakeholders experiencing the outcome.

Note that what is most critical for organizations to capture is not necessarily the long list of ecosystem services provided, but rather the key ecosystem services and their quality. Organizations may choose to identify the top 3-5 ecosystem services provided from this list, then track their changes in quality over time.\n\nThe number, variety, and balance of ecosystem services is a good indicator of ecosystem health. A disproportionate share of human-induced provisioning services like crops and timber generally indicates poor ecosystem health (e.g., intensive agriculture, intensive forestry). The value of  ecosystem services can be expressed in physical (e.g., amount of groundwater supplied in m³) or monetary terms. Monetary valuation of ecosystem services is complex and requires expert support but enables comparison and aggregation. Assessing ecosystem services at the site or project level uses specific tools such as InVEST or Aries and generally requires expert advice. \n\nThe societal value of ecosystems is deeply related to the benefits they provide people, specifically ecosystem services, making this metric a proxy for the social value of biodiversity. Organizations are encouraged to report this metric alongside others in the Biodiversity IRIS+ Core Metrics Set, as tailored to context, that give a complementary, more complete picture of biodiversity performance.\n\nExamples of details to footnote include how the ecosystem provides the selected ecosystem services, the methodology used to measure and value the ecosystem services, information on which services were covered, and any external validation or verification conducted to evaluate the provision of the selected ecosystem services. For external validation or verification, organizations should footnote which services were covered, the date of evaluation, and the entity conducting verification/validation (e.g., university researcher, consultant, ecosystem services bank).\n\nOrganizations can apply this metric in risk screening (‘which ecosystem services are at risk due to the investment?’), identifying restoration opportunities (‘which ecosystem services can benefit from an investment in restoration?’), and comparison (‘which product innovations or locations for restoration are most promising in terms of generating ecosystem services?’).\n\nOrganizations are encouraged to report this metric in conjunction with Protected Land Area: Total (PI4716), Protected Land Area: Permanent (PI3924), Land Directly Controlled: Sustainably Managed (OI6912), Land Indirectly Controlled: Sustainably Managed (PI6796), Land Directly Controlled: Total (OI5408), and Land Indirectly Controlled: Total (PI3789).\n\nThe detailed options for this metric were sourced from the World Resources Institute (WRI).', 1, 1, 'Product Description', 'Product/Service Information', 1, NULL, 'Product/Service, Organization', 'Flow', 'Selection', NULL, NULL),
